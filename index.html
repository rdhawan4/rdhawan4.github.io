									<h4>Restaurant Revenue Prediction using Regression</h4>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/reg.png" alt="" /></span>
									<ul style="font-size: 14px;">
										<li>In this regression project, we tackled a critical challenge faced by TFI, a global company operating over 1,200 quick-service restaurants, including well-known brands like Burger King, Sbarro, Popeyes, Usta Donerci, and Arby’s. The company's success hinges on strategically opening new restaurant sites across different regions, a process primarily reliant on subjective judgments from development teams. However, this approach lacks precision and often leads to losses when wrong locations are chosen.</li>
										<li>To address this issue, we embarked on a mission to develop a data-driven mathematical model that could predict the annual restaurant sales of 100,000 regional locations. Leveraging demographic, real estate, and commercial data, we implemented various techniques to enhance the effectiveness of investments in new restaurant sites.</li>
										<li>Our journey began with feature transformation using One Hot Encoding for categorical data, which allowed us to represent non-numeric data in a suitable format for analysis. To streamline the data further, we employed feature selection, dropping correlated features with a threshold of more than 80%. This process ensured that only the most relevant and informative features were used for prediction.</li>
										<li>The heart of our project lay in regression analysis, where we applied several algorithms, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, MLP Regressor, Support Vector Regressor, and Ridge Regressors. These models enabled us to build predictive relationships between the data features and annual restaurant sales, providing valuable insights for decision-making.</li>
										<li>To further enhance the model's accuracy, we employed stacking using VecStack, a technique that combines multiple models' predictions to produce more robust and precise results. Additionally, we diligently optimized the models through hyperparameter tuning, fine-tuning their parameters for maximum performance. <a href="https://github.com/rdhawan4/Restaurant-Revenue-Prediction/blob/main/RestaurantRevenuePrediction.ipynb"> (LINK) </a></li>

									<!-- Classifcation -->
									<h4>Homesite Quote Conversion using Supervised Classification </h4>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/homesite.png" alt="" /></span>
									<ul style="font-size: 14px;">
										<li>In this classification project, our goal was to predict the QuoteConversion_Flag for potential customers interested in buying policies from Homesite. The dataset provided a comprehensive representation of customer and policy information, containing anonymized features related to coverage, sales, personal details, property, and geographic data.</li>
										<li>To ensure accurate predictions, we initially cleaned the dataset and removed any null values. However, during exploratory data analysis (EDA), we discovered that the dataset was imbalanced, with one class significantly outnumbering the other. To address this issue, we implemented the SMOTE strategy only on training dataset, generating synthetic data points for the minority class, thereby balancing the dataset.</li>
										<li>For data preparation, we transformed all categorical data points into one-hot encoded values to ensure compatibility with various classification algorithms. We then created and fine-tuned several individual models, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, Linear SVC, KNN, and MLP Classifiers, using hyperparameter techniques such as random search and grid search for optimal performance.</li>
										<li>To further enhance the accuracy of our predictions, we designed an ensemble prediction model using a one-layer stacking approach. This ensemble model combined the strengths of Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, Multi-Layer Perceptron, and K-Nearest Neighbors classifiers. Through meticulous fine-tuning and integration, we achieved an impressive accuracy rate of over 90% <a href="https://github.com/rdhawan4/Homesite-Quote-Conversion/blob/main/HomesiteQuoteConversion.ipynb"> (LINK) </a></li></li>
									</ul>
									<h4>Fraud Detection using Machine Learning</h4>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/fraud.svg" alt="" /></span>
									<ul style="font-size: 14px;">
										<li>In this data mining project focused on fraud detection, we address the widespread issue of fraud across domains such as auto insurance claims, health insurance claims, credit card transactions, and financial transactions. Utilizing data from an actual auto insurance company, each record in the dataset represents an insurance claim, with the last column indicating its fraudulent status.</li>
										<li>Our ML Pipeline follows a similar approach to the above method, with a key emphasis during model evaluation on minimizing False Negatives. Our goal is to avoid misclassifying fraudulent transactions as regular ones. By prioritizing the reduction of False Negatives, we aim to enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of our fraud detection system. <a href="https://github.com/rdhawan4/Auto-Insurance-Fraud-Detection/blob/main/Auto%20Insurance%20Fraud%20Detection.ipynb"> (LINK) </a></li></li>

									<h4>CostCo Topic Modeling & Sentiment Analysis</h4>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/costco.png" width="560px" /></span>
									<p></p>
									<ul style="font-size: 14px;">
										<li>In the Costco NLP Project, our primary focus was to gain insights from customer reviews on Reddit related to Costco products and services. To achieve this, we collected a substantial dataset of around 99,000 customer reviews using web scraping through the Reddit PRAW API. By removing stop words, applying stemming, and lemmatizing tokens, we ensured that the text data was refined and ready for analysis.</li>
										<li>Our analysis began with Topic Modeling using gensim's LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) to categorize each review into different topics. To determine the optimal number of clusters or topics, we employed coherence plots, ensuring meaningful and relevant groupings of customer discussions.</li>
										<li>Next, we delved into Sentiment Analysis, a crucial aspect of NLP, to understand the overall sentiment of the reviews. Leveraging TextBlob and VADER models, we calculated Polarity scores for each review, enabling us to gauge its positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.</li>
										<li>By combining the results of Topic Modeling and Sentiment Analysis, we effectively categorized the sentiment associated with various topics discussed on Reddit about Costco. This comprehensive analysis provided valuable insights into customer perceptions, allowing Costco to gain a deeper understanding of its products and services' strengths and areas of improvement. <a href="https://github.com/rdhawan4/Costco-Topic-Modeling-Sentiment-Analysis/blob/main/Costco_TopicModeling_SentimentAnalysis.ipynb"> (LINK) </a></li></li>

									<h4>Text Mining with Customer Comments</h4>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/text.svg" alt="" /></span>
									<ul style="font-size: 14px;">
										<li>In this project, we harness the combined power of NLP and ML to predict customer churn in a Telecommunication Company. By integrating structured (personal) and unstructured (complaint text) data, our powerful predictive model accurately identifies potential churners, enabling data-driven decisions for improved customer retention and satisfaction.</li>
										<li>Our process begins by transforming the semi-structured complaint data from "comments.csv" into a usable TFIDF matrix. We also preprocess categorical data points in the personal information to ensure it's ready for analysis. Next, we employ feature selection using both Filter and Wrapper methods, ensuring only meaningful features are included, enhancing the model's performance and interpretability.</li>
										<li>For model development, we utilize Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting algorithms to build predictive models.</li>
										<li>This project showcases the power of incorporating text data into predictive modeling, providing deeper insights into customer behavior and driving strategic business decisions for the Telecommunication Company. <a href="https://github.com/rdhawan4/Text-Mining_NLP/blob/main/TextMining.ipynb"> (LINK) </a></li></li>

									<h4>Retail Product Detection using Computer Vision</h4>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/deeplearning.svg" alt="" /></span>
									<ul style="font-size: 14px;">
										<li>In this Computer Vision project, our aim is to build a robust Retail product detection method using convolutional neural nets. To achieve this, we created a training dataset for specific products (Hotdog, Soda, Coffee, Banana) by collecting 200 diverse images for each product through web scraping using Beautiful Soup. We standardized image sizes, renamed them based on their classes, and manually validated the dataset for effective training.</li>
										<li>For accurate product detection, we implemented a CNN model with transfer learning. By fine-tuning the ResNet50, VGG16, and InceptionV3 pre-trained models and re-configuring their architectures, we adapted them to identify the targeted products.</li>
										<li>Our efforts resulted in impressive outcomes, with the RESNET50 model achieving a remarkable validation accuracy of 91% in just 10 epochs.</li>
										<li>To enhance user experience, we designed a user-friendly Streamlit interface. This intuitive platform enables seamless model selection, threshold adjustment, and real-time image capturing, facilitating instant product classification and easy cart addition. <a href="https://github.com/rdhawan4/Product-Identification-using-Convolution-Neural-Nets/blob/main/BackendModel_InceptionV3.ipynb"> (LINK) </a></li></li>
